Quiz Answer Key

1. What are the three core languages of website development and what are their specific roles? The three core languages are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML controls the structure of the page via tags, CSS handles the presentation and design such as layout and colors, and JavaScript is responsible for adding behavior and interactivity.
2. How does JavaScript differ from "full" programming languages like C++ or Java in terms of capability? JavaScript is often classified as a scripting language because it is intentionally limited compared to languages like C++ or Java. Specifically, it lacks the ability to communicate directly with a computer's file system or interact directly with databases.
3. What is meant by the term "client-side language" in the context of JavaScript? A client-side language is one that runs locally on the user's own computer within their web browser. This means the code is executed after it has been retrieved from the server and delivered to the user's machine.
4. According to the source, what is a practical example of a feature JavaScript provides for a web page? A practical example is an image gallery where a user can click on individual images to zoom in or out. This type of interactive behavior is typically handled by JavaScript to make the website more engaging.
5. How does the execution of JavaScript differ from languages like PHP or Ruby on Rails? While JavaScript runs on the client's browser, languages like PHP, Ruby on Rails, and ASP.NET run on the server. In those cases, the code executes on the server first, and only the results of that code are sent to the user's web browser for display.
6. What is the recommended approach for integrating JavaScript into a website's functionality? Developers should first build a website so that it runs completely fine on its own without JavaScript. Once the core functionality is established, JavaScript should be added to provide "the magic touch" and enhanced interactivity.
7. Why is it considered "not very good" to design a shopping basket that relies solely on JavaScript? A website should be accessible to everyone regardless of whether they have JavaScript enabled or not. If a core function like adding items to a shopping basket requires JavaScript, users without it will be unable to use the site effectively.
8. What is the historical reason behind the name "JavaScript"? JavaScript has no actual relation to the Java programming language. It was given the name "JavaScript" simply to jump on the "bandwagon" of Java's popularity at the time the language was being introduced.
9. What is the official technical name for JavaScript? The official name for the language is ECMAScript. Although this is its formal title, most developers and users continue to refer to it simply as JavaScript.
10. What happens after a user types a URL into their browser and communicates with a server? The browser communicates with the server to request information, which the server then sends back to the computer. This data, usually a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is then processed and displayed by the browser as a functional web page.

Essay Discussion Prompts

* The Architecture of Interactivity: Discuss the specific role JavaScript plays in the "Three Core Languages" of the web. How does its purpose differ fundamentally from HTML and CSS?
* The Scripting Language Debate: Analyze why some programmers disregard JavaScript as a "scripting language" rather than a "programming language." Does its lack of direct access to file systems and databases diminish its value in modern web development?
* Client-Side vs. Server-Side Processing: Compare and contrast the workflows of client-side languages like JavaScript with server-side technologies like PHP and Ruby on Rails. What are the implications for the user's computer and the remote server?
* The Philosophy of Progressive Enhancement: Explain the argument against relying on JavaScript for core website features like shopping carts. Why is accessibility a critical consideration in web design?
* Branding and Standards: Explore the relationship and distinctions between JavaScript, Java, and ECMAScript. How has historical branding influenced the public perception of these technologies?
